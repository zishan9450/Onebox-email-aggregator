## üîß **How to Switch Providers**

You can easily switch between providers by changing one line in your `.env` file:

```bash
# For Local AI (free, no API key needed)
AI_PROVIDER=local

# For Hugging Face (free tier, needs API key)
AI_PROVIDER=huggingface
HUGGINGFACE_API_KEY=hf_your-key-here

# For OpenAI (when quota resets)
AI_PROVIDER=openai
OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-your-key-here
```

---

## üéØ **Recommendation**

**Start with Local AI** - it's already configured and will work immediately without any setup. You can always upgrade to Hugging Face or back to OpenAI later when your quota resets.

The Local AI will categorize emails based on keywords and generate appropriate replies, which should be sufficient for testing and demonstration purposes.
